# Summer-Internship-2021
Day 1- Completed Chapter 1 in Lifelong Machine Learning book, written a small summary of understanding( Available in the Master branch ), and implemented basic pytorch functions and also learnt and implemented about Linear Regression and gradient descent( Code available in the Main branch) Google Colab was used for the implementation part.
Day 2 - Completed Chapter 2 in Lifelong Machine Learning book, done with a small summary( Updated under Master branch) and the first and very basic neural network implemented in Pytorch( Code available in the master branch),the code was done using Google Colab.
