# Summer-Internship-2021
Day 1- Completed Chapter 1 in Lifelong Machine Learning book, written a small summary of understanding( Available in the Master branch ), and implemented basic pytorch functions and also learnt and implemented about Linear Regression and gradient descent( Code available in the Main branch) Google Colab was used for the implementation part.

Day 2 - Completed Chapter 2 in Lifelong Machine Learning book, done with a small summary( Updated under Master branch) and the first and very basic neural network implemented in Pytorch( Code available in the master branch),the code was done using Google Colab.

Day 3 - Started Chapter 3 in Lifelong Machine Learning book, summary upto the point read updated as summary (Doc available in Master branch) implemented logistic regression Neural network on the MNIST dataset achieved accuracy of 85.6%, uploaded the code available in Main branch, also read about K Means Clustering, code implemented in Google Colab.

Day 4 - Did some reading and understood the concepts about Natural Language Processing and how they work, got insights about Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTM's and LSTM-CNN for image captioning, updated the summary of today's work in Master branch. No code implementation today.
